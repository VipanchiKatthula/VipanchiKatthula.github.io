I used Multi-threading (explained later) to run parallel operations. I used Google Colab to run the model and you can find the required [\u0026ldquo;Pride_and_Prejudice.txt\u0026rdquo;] file here.\nGoal First, let\u0026rsquo;s map the words in the provided text to 1 using the mapper as \u0026lt;Word,1\u0026gt; and then use reducer to find the word count in the format \u0026lt;Word,Count\u0026gt;. A reducer also sorts the words which needs to be separately added to the series of operations. I implement the multi threading in python to parallelly get the word counts from two lists of words.\nInput File inputfile = open('/content/drive/My Drive/IDS561BigData/Assignment1/Pride_and_Prejudice.txt',\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;)\rtext = inputfile.read()\r Data cleaning In order for us to use the text from the book, we have to remove the the punctuations, unnecessary numbers as they won\u0026rsquo;t help us understand the text in most cases.\nWe remove the numbers, convert the text to lower case using .lower() command and use Regular Expressions to replace punctuations with a space ' '. I then remove those Lines with no text in them.\ndef data_clean(text):\rNoNumbers = ''.join([i for i in text if not i.isdigit()]) #Removing numbers\rNoNumbers = text.lower() #Making the text to lower case\rimport re\ronlyText = re.sub(r\u0026quot;[^a-z\\s]+\u0026quot;,' ',NoNumbers) #Removing punctuation\rfinaltext = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;.join([s for s in onlyText.strip().splitlines(True) if s.strip()]) #Removing the null lines\rreturn finaltext\r Splitting data into two parts Let\u0026rsquo;s define a reusable function which takes a list of words as input to do multi-threading on the given data set. Here \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; is the number of words after you wish to make the split. For example, splitlines(text,200) will split the text into split1 and split2 as two sentences with first 1 to 199 words in split1 and rest in split2.\ndef splitlines(text,a):\rlinessplit = text.splitlines() #Splitting the lines into a list\rsplit1 = linessplit[0:a] #Creating the first split with the first \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; number of lines into split 1\rsplit2 = linessplit[a:] #Creating the second split with the first \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; number of lines into split 2\rreturn split1,split2\r Mapper We map all the words in \u0026ldquo;text\u0026rdquo; to 1 using the keyval.append([j,1]) command.

It’s a measure of similarity for the two sets of data, with a range from 0% to 100%. The higher the percentage, the more similar the two populations.\n#How to calculate: The formula to find the Index is:\nJaccard Index = (the number in both sets) / (the number in either set) * 100\nThe same formula in notation is: J(X,Y) = |X∩Y| / |X∪Y| In Steps, that’s:\n1.Count the number of members which are shared between both sets. 2.Count the total number of members in both sets (shared and un-shared). 3.Divide the number of shared members (1) by the total number of members (2). 4.Multiply the number you found in (3) by 100.\nCosine Similarity: Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors of an inner product space. It is measured by the cosine of the angle between two vectors and determines whether two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction. Any document can be represented by thousands of attributes, each recording the frequency of a particular word (such as a keyword) or phrase in the document. Thus, each document is an object represented by what is called a term-frequency vector.\nI used python function to calculate the text similarity rather than using the traditional way of calculating by using the formula.\nSources: https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/jaccard-index/\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/cosine-similarity\n","date":1580601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580601600,"objectID":"3d0710ee4f5d5708e09c3d6caba4847e","permalink":"https://vipanchikatthula.github.io/project/jaccard-cosine-similarity/","publishdate":"2020-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/jaccard-cosine-similarity/","section":"project","summary":"Finding similarity between documents.","tags":["NLP"],"title":"Jaccard Cosine Similarity","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.
